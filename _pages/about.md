Hey there! So glad you stopped by my page! Let me introduce myself real quick ~  :heart::heart::heart:\n
I’m an undergraduate student at Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, working under the awesome guidance of [Ye Wang](https://wangye0523.github.io/). Oh, and just for fun, my MBTI is INFJ, haha! I’m super into sci-fi novels and movies—can’t get enough of them! Best wishes for our future adventures! :kissing_heart:
